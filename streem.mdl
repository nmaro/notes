I'm pretty confident that the "stream" (an append-only log of messages) is a pretty solid basic datastructure, on top of which a great number of abstractions can be built

eing reflexive, on the other hand, is being aware of how one is actually experiencing the present moment as it unfolds. It means noticing where our energy wants to go, and where we resist or avoid going. It means being conscious of our bodily postures, and the subtle shifts in our mood. It means being fully involved in the participation, at the mico-cosmic level of the individual, while simultaneously participating with others. It means being able to hold into awareness how one is situated in the experience, and how this situatedness subtly shifts and morphs in response to the participation.

A reflexive approach is a kind of embodied vigilance which keeps language in check, constantly measuring the conceptual, representational, symbolic and narrative aspects of discourse against the immediacy of the embodied experience and the native context that situates oneself through participation.

For me, one of the most compelling things about this online space is that we have the minimum number of people (3) required to achieve anonymity and to have an audience. I am curious to see what kind of thinking we can come up together with here.

So with that said, I'd suggest showing the software to people in groups of 3. (Initially, at least). It is easy to see something like this veering into non-coherence/chaos if it's not easy for "norms" to emerge and be adopted quickly.

my intuition is that to solve the highly complex problems we are dealing with as a civilization such as climate change (or insert your favorite complex problem here) we need multidimentional (as in for all kinds of resources, from time to intections to trust to raw materials to atoms) accounting to be pervasive. That's how we can internalize externalities and close cycles (e.g. the carbon cycle), and more generally provide rich information for better sense- and decision making for all involved agents (whether algorithmic or human). Would you say this is within ir beyond the scope of ERA, how do you resonate with these ideas?

The fact that the publicly shared versions of "my" feeds is readonly fills me with peace of mind. I gives me a certain mental protection towards validation-seeking behaviors (wondering what people will think/like/comment). I know if someone needs to respond to something they can reach out to me.

What works for most of us is to establish one oasis of perfection – the ceremony – as best we are able, and then to allow it to ripple out across our lifescape, progressively bringing more attention, beauty, and power into every act. To make every act a ceremony begins with making one act a ceremony.

Here is how it might work. You start with a rudimentary ceremony, perhaps lighting a candle each morning and taking a moment to meditate on who you want to be today. But how do you light the candle perfectly? Maybe you pick it up and tilt it over the match. The where do you put the match? On a little plate perhaps, kept off to the side. And you put the candle back down just right. Then maybe you ring a chime three times. How long between rings? Are you in a hurry? No, you wait until each tone fades into silence? Yes, that is how to do it....

Full attention and integrity takes different forms in different circumstances. In a ritual it means something quite different than it does in a game, a conversation, or cooking dinner. In one situation it might demand precision and order; in another, spontaneity, daring, or improvisation.

I think one simplification of the Game B Grand Narrative is this: "OK, so we (humans) now see that we're all one big family on one big world. We're largely in agreement that "killing people" and "destroying the earth" is something we don't want to do. We are all stuck together whether we like it or not, there is no escape, there is no exit. Now what? How are we going to get along?"

#gameb version of organising people is something I’m reflecting on now. Focus on relational bonds rather than rivalrous idea battles fixed on extracting utility in the human exchanges.  Coming back to the question of who do I/we have to become rather than what do we have to do.

I've been reading it through. It's really neat. It also raises all kinds of questions of "how to we share?" around Game B. He originally approached me to see if we'd want to collaborate on "finishing" the document, writing it up into a completed guide.

I think the most exciting and compelling way to publish it is for him to share it "as is", in its incomplete state. It's anti-rivalrous. It invites people in. No one is creating "polished, completed objects" in Game B discourse yet; it's all just a work in progress.

The secret of "not for profit org" Game A grant funding is that there is almost no grant money for individuals. There is grant money for organizations, which ideally are "incorporated" and "with charitible status" and have been around for a while.

In the non profit space, people focus on funding "the cause" rather than individuals. Individual genius and capacity is underconsidered/valued (this is where startup culture / founder focus has a leg up).

To-  day humanity, as never before, is split into two apparently irrec-oncilable halves. The psychological rule says that when an in-  ner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate.  That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and  does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must  perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.

P2P is therefore primarily a mode of relationship that allows human beings to be connected and organized in networks, to collaborate, produce and share. The collaboration is often permissionless, meaning that one may not need the permission of another to contribute. The P2P system is, therefore, generally open to all contributors and contributions. The quality and inclusion of the work are usually determined “post-hoc” by a layer of maintainers and editors, as in the case of Wikipedia.

P2P can also be a mode to allocate resources that do not involve any specific reciprocity between individuals but only between the individuals and the collective resource.

P2P can generally be synonymous with “commoning,” in the sense that it describes the capacity to contribute to the creation and maintenance of any shared resource.

How can "there always is a win win choice" and "the rightful sacrifice" be compatible?

If you constantly have to sacrifice a part of yourself to evolve, that's not very "win" for the part of you that has to die

> Quick note: I feel a bit guilty about giving priority to streams rather than our regular convos. At this point I feel like it's just about plain old fun. I just feel like a moment of fun. And engaging with you on streams is fun. The weekly calls are a bit more intense - not sure if that's the right word.

I'm not actively tying to be vegan, but I've done more animal-free eating as of late, because i love love love using my Instantpot automatic pressure cooker and my fancy vitamix blender.

I love the "magic" of cooking beans, lentils and chickpeas in the instant pot. It's cheap and efficient, so it means I've been making more bean salads and vegetarian curries.

And there have been times when I've had to bring a dish to a potluck, and I've thought "better make it vegan and gluten free" to accommodate the various eating limitations people have these days. On those occasions, I've stretched myself to learn a new recipe that others will think will "taste good".

All of this is to say, one approach to being vegan / more vegan could be to "endeavor to be good & efficient at vegan cooking", and not invest any time in making food with meat/animal ingredients.

This is, at its most fundamental level, the Game of Life: the potential for infinite downside at any possible moment, balanced against hard-won upside that ever only amounts to the next round’s ante. We therefore observe the Sisyphean struggle baked into the foundations of consciousness itself.

if suffering characterizes an emergent process whose sensitivity adapts to increasingly fine-grained disruptions, we should not expect to meaningfully reduce subjectively perceived human suffering without severely disrupting the fundamental symmetries that give rise to consciousness itself.

this is precisely what we would expect of an organism whose conscious awareness arises out of habituation to stable symmetries and sensitization to disruptions upon an ever-finer fractal boundary. In fact, it is in no way obvious that the processual symmetries discussed thus far could arise–much less stabilize–without the capacity to suffer in a manner that promotes self-preservation, given that our concept of suffering maps at its deepest level to the basic detection of symmetry breakage.

Jump to navigation Jump to search We ask you, humbly, to help. Dear reader in Switzerland, it seems you use Wikipedia a lot; that's great! It's a little awkward to ask, but today we need your help. We’re not salespeople. We’re librarians, archivists, and information junkies. We depend on donations averaging CHF 15, but fewer than 1% of readers give. If you donate just CHF 4 - the price of your coffee today, Wikipedia could keep thriving. Thank you.  Close A spiritual bypass or spiritual bypassing is a "tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"

To make the record, we now push a pencil or tap a typewriter. Then comes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an intricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution. To consider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the future cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the record? He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax cylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his talk directly produce a typed record. All he needs to do is to take advantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.
